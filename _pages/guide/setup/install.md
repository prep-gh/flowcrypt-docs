This assumes you already have Google Chrome (or Firefox) installed.

With FlowCrypt, encrypting and decrypting happens on your device. This means that you will have to install FlowCrypt on each device you want to send and receive encrypted messages from.

Go to [flowcrypt.com{{site.data.i.external}}](https://flowcrypt.com){:target="_blank"} and click **Get Chrome Extension**:

If this is the first time you are using encryption on this account, click [New Encryption Key](new-private-key.html).

Else if you have used OpenPGP encryption software from another vendor in the past and want to import your previous private key, see [Use My Own Private Key](import-private-key.html).
