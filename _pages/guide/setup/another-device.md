| You know your Pass Phrase from the previous setup. See [Forgotten Pass Phrases](/docs/help/forgot-pass-phrase.html)
| You have already installed flowcrypt on a second device by following [Install FlowCrypt](install.html)

## Steps

After you click `Continue with Gmail` during installation, you will be presented with:

Here, enter your Pass Phrase (must be the same as when you initially set up FlowCrypt on this account) and click `Recover Account`.

You can now read your encrypted emails on both devices.
