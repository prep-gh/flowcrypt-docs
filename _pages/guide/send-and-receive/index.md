With FlowCrypt, you can send encrypted email to FlowCrypt user or non FlowCrypt User.

You can also send encrypted attachments up to 5MB in size for free, and up to 25MB with a [paid subscription](https://flowcrypt.com/pricing).

Choose a link that describes what you'd like to do:

|:---|---:
| [is a FlowCrypt user](send-to-flowcrypt.html) | [Opening an email with FlowCrypt](open-email-with-flowcrypt.html) |
