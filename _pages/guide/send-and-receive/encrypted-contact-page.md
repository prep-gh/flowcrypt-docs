Contact page allows anyone to send you encrypted messages and files without having to install any software. Their message will be encrypted in their browser before sending, and delivered to your email.

## Enable Encrypted Contact Page

Go to [FlowCrypt Settings](../common-tasks/open-settings.html) -> `Encrypted Contact Page`:

On the following page, click `Get trial` on the bottom:

{{site.data.box.info}}
Encrypted Contact Page is a free feature and does not require a paid subscription. It will ask you to enable the trial because that way the software can easily verify your email address.

We will be improving this so that users don't have to go through the trial signup unnecessarily.
{{site.data.box.end}}

{{ "contact-page/settings-page" | screenshot }}

When done, you will see a link to your Encrypted Contact Page that you can share with others. You will also be able to customize the name, picture and description showing on your contact page.
