On your laptop or computer, FlowCrypt allows you to view encrypted email directly from [https://mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com){:target="_blank"}

Click on the newly received message:

{{ "browser/openingemailwithFC/encryptedemailininbox" | screenshot }}

Message will be automatically decrypted, just like when viewing any other email:

{{data.site.box.info}}
Depending on your settings, you may be asked to enter your pass phrase first.
{{data.site.box.end}}
