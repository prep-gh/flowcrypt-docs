title: OpenPGP encryption on other platforms
summary: Find out which software offers the best interoperability with FlowCrypt
---

At the moment, we offer FlowCrypt as a browser extension (for Gmail) and as an Android App (for all email providers).

We hope to eventually cover all major platforms ([get notified when we reach your platform](https://flowcrypt.com/download)).

Until then, below is a curated list of FlowCrypt alternatives that we think are workable.

We endorse these as good solutions, with some limitations as noted.

Software may be missing on this list if we didn't have a chance to test it or we are not comfortable recommending it (in terms of usability, security, maturity, etc).

If you know an OpenPGP solution that you think should be included, please let us know (also note why you like it and which other solutions you tested).

{{site.data.box.info}}
Please consider the `Setup` and `Use` difficulty evaluations as our impression and nothing more. Software complexity is very individual, what seems difficult to us may seem simple to you and vice versa. Every software has both some great solutions and some unintuitive bits, including our own software. This makes evaluating and rating ease of use rather difficult.
