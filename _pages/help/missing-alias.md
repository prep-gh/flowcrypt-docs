If you use several sending addresses on your Gmail account but FlowCrypt did not recognize all of them:

1) Go to `FlowCrypt Settings` -> `Additional Settings` -> `Attester` -> `Refresh list`

2) The missing email address should show up. Now click `Submit` next to it so that it shows in green color.

You should now be able to use the alias as a sending address when using secure compose.
