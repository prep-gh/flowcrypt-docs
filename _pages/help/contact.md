## About FlowCrypt

FlowCrypt was first released in 2015 to address the horrible state of usability of email encryption. Things have since been improving, also thanks to work by other companies in our space. We are working and looking towards the day when there is no usability difference between encrypted and plain email, so that everyone who cares about privacy can use it easily. To learn more about FlowCrypt, see [our blog{{site.data.i.external}}](https://flowcrypt.com/blog/).

We are completely self funded. No venture capital, no outside investments, no government grants. We earn our revenue from enterprise sales (plus a handful of personal or SMB customers who upgrade to a paid plan). 

We work as a distributed team, and we are hiring. See [FlowCrypt GitHub Page](https://github.com/FlowCrypt) to get more familiar with our technical stack.
