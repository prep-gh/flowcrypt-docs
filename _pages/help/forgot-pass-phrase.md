If you still have at least one device where you can read encrypted email (and are trying to set up another one), open the working device and go to `FlowCrypt Settings` -> `Security` -> `Change pass phrase`. It will let you change it without knowing the previous one. This will then allow you to use the new pass phrase when setting up another device.

If you cannot read encrypted email on any device without the pass phrase anymore, you will not be able to read previously encrypted emails regardless of what you do. To set up everything again, you can go to `FlowCrypt Settings` -> `Additional Settings` -> `Experimental` -> `Reset account`. Then during setup, you would give it a wrong pass phrase, which will allow you to set it up again with a new pass phrase for future emails.
