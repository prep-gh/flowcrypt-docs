# flowcrypt-docs

To prepare your environment first time:
```
make bootstrap
```

To build docs and serve them on localhost:
```
make serve
```

Docs site will be built into `./_site` directory and served at `http://localhost:4000/docs/`.


Once localhost is running, you can run tests:
```
make test
```
