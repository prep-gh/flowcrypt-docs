# Request, per Tom

## Screen shots for blog posts.

@Anton can I please get some iPhone (*not iPOD*) screens shots of the very latest app?  

(Anything from the "iOS pentest group" from their testing, would be nice as well)

* Having an iPhone skin around the display would be good.
* PNG if possible?
* Transparent background behind the skin, if possible.
* The larger the better. (But don't resize them bigger after the capture).
