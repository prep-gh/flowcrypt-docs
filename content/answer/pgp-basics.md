If the recipient has encryption set up, nothing special is needed. Just use the "Secure Compose" to write them an encrypted message.

Your pass phrase that you set up earlier should always stay private, don't share that with anyone.

Anytime you write someone who doesn't seem to have encryption set up, the recipient email will turn grey (in Secure Compose). These messages will have to be protected with an additional password that you share with the recipient (you'll be prompted for one if needed).
