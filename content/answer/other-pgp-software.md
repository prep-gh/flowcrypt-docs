# Messaging to people who already use PGP

> was wondering, if I wanted to send an email to someone with PGP already enabled on their email, do I need to publish my keys anywhere else (ex MIT servers etc) and also, do I need to pay to upgrade the account or is that part of the free package?

It's free. You may need to send them your public key attached, otherwise everything should work normally.
