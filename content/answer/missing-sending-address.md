# How to add a missing sending (alias) address?

> Hello, I use several sending addresses on my Gmail account, but FlowCrypt did not recognize all of them. How to add the missing ones?

Make sure to send at least one standard email from that missing address as a sender, from Gmail. Then go to

FlowCrypt Settings -> Additional Settings -> Experimental -> refresh send-from addresses

FlowCrypt Settings -> Additional Settings -> Attester (and click submit next to it)

This will make it appear along the other ones.
