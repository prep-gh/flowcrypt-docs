# Does FlowCrypt encrypt attachments too?

> Do I use all my messages in the secure compose now, or can I use the other compose as well? I'm unsure how the encryption works. Do I need to tell my friends to get the encryption thing too? Or does this encrypt all messages to and from people either way?

For each message, you get to choose if you want it encrypted or not. If you want the message encrypted, use Secure Compose, otherwise use the normal one.

You can send an encrypted message to anyone, but it's more convenient if the other side has encryption set up as well, because if they don't, you'll need to add a password to protect the message with, and the other person needs that password to open that message - that's too cumbersome for normal communication, but appropriate if you need to send something sensitive.

What I do is this:
 - if I know both of us use encryption, I'd use Secure Compose, becaause it's just as convenient and it's encrypted
 - if I'm sending something sensitive, I'd use Secure Compose even if the other person doesn't have encryption set up, and then communicate a password to them to use to open the message
 - everything else (chitchatting) I'll use standard compose
