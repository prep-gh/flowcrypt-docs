# Can I set up two encrypted contact forms?


> If I am using FlowCrypt with two gmail accounts, is there a way to get two encrypted contact forms? or is there a way to switch which email account gets the contact form? I signed up for the advanced account and I can't figure out the answers to these two issues.

Sure, let me know which email address is it currently on, and which one would you like to set up - I will do it manually.

Also let me know if you just want to switch it to the other email address, or have two different links that go to different emails - I can do either.

In the future, it will be possible to use your plugin to manage more than one encrypted contact page yourself.
