## Using FlowCrypt Keyserver from other software

> Just checking out the product in Firefox. Love it!
>
> I had a quick question. Have you thought anymore about the ability to add a keyserver(s) or access to the FlowCrypt keyserver with other software? I've been showing it around but a lot of my colleges are die-hard outlook fans and use encryptomatic. Any way to put one of the other key servers into cryptup or access the cryptup keyserver in encryptomatic would be great. We generally use the mit server.

> Thanks again for an awesome product.

Simply add <b>attester.flowcrypt.com</b> or <b>https://attester.flowcrypt.com</b> as a keyserver in the settings of whatever OpenPGP software you use. This will allow your software to start pulling public keys of FlowCrypt users seamlessly.

If that doesn't work, please write us so that we can find out why. Meanwhile you can always download individual keys from <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/lookup">FlowCrypt Attester Lookup</a>.

## Sync with keyservers

> Q: Do you plan to make keys available via gpg --search-keys?
