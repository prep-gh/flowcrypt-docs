## Domain-wide settings and restrictions

You can restrict FlowCrypt usage to pre-approved set of functionality, such as:
 - set domain-wide account settings (language, message expiration)
 - disable password-protected messages
 - disable private key backups
 - enforce message signing
 - enforce entering pass phrase for every session
 - forbid or enforce pass phrase changes
 - tell us what you need: `human@flowcrypt.com`

## Legacy systems compatibility

We will help make FlowCrypt compatible with your (or customer/vendor) current systems for interoperability.

Integration or enforcement of use of your current key management mechanisms, LDAP servers, etc.

## Custom security rules

In addition to security settings listed in [Domain-wide settings and restrictions](#domain-wide-settings-and-restrictions), you can also enforce use of Private Keys that matche your current Public Key server (which FlowCrypt can integrate with).

FlowCrypt will follow a set of security rules that your business or regulatory requirements demand.

This can involve public key servers, hardware security modules, or other internal systems.
