This assumes you already have Google Chrome browser installed. The instructions are very similar if you use Firefox.

With FlowCrypt, encrypting and decrypting happens on your device. This means that you will have to install FlowCrypt on each device you want to send and receive encrypted messages from.

Go to [flowcrypt.com](https://flowcrypt.com){:target="_blank"} and click **Get Chrome Extension**:

On Chrome Web Store, click **Add to Chrome**:

Click the **FlowCrypt icon** in the top right corder of your browser to set up FlowCrypt:

Click **Continue with Gmail**:

A new window will pop up. Choose the email address you'd like to use:

Click allow on the next screen:

If this is your very first time using FlowCrypt, you will be presented with two choices (if you already set up FlowCrypt before and now you are doing it again on a second device, see [Setting up FlowCrypt on another device](another-device) instead):

If this is the first time you are using encryption on this account, click [New Encryption Key](new-private-key.md).

Else if you have used OpenPGP encryption software from another vendor in the past and want to import your previous private key, see [Use My Own Private Key](import-private-key.md).
