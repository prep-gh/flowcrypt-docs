This assumes you already have Google Chrome browser installed. The instructions are very similar if you use Firefox.

With FlowCrypt, encrypting and decrypting happens on your device. This means that you will have to install FlowCrypt on each device you want to send and receive encrypted messages from.

Go to [flowcrypt.com](https://flowcrypt.com){:target="_blank"} and click **Get Chrome Extension**:

If this is your very first time using FlowCrypt, you will be presented with two choices

{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}}
If this is not your first time setting up FlowCrypt on this account, you may see a recovery prompt instead. See [Setting up FlowCrypt on another device](another-device.html).
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

If this is the first time you are using encryption on this account, click [New Encryption Key](new-private-key.md).

Else if you have used OpenPGP encryption software from another vendor in the past and want to import your previous private key, see [Use My Own Private Key](import-private-key.md).
